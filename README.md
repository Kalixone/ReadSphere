# üìö Overview of ReadSphere

Welcome to the documentation of the "ReadSphere" project based on Java Spring.

The ReadSphere API is a Java-based RESTful interface designed for managing generic online bookstores. It offers a comprehensive set of endpoints essential for building a fully functional online bookshop.

With this API, you have access to a wide range of operations, including:

- **Adding new books to the inventory**
- **Updating book details** such as title, author, and price
- **Retrieving detailed information** about books in the store
- **Managing shopping carts** by adding books and updating quantities
- **Placing orders** for books

Additionally, the API features robust user authentication and authorization mechanisms, allowing you to control access to specific endpoints based on user roles, ensuring secure and controlled interactions with the system.

## üõ† Challenges Faced During Project Development

### Docker

üê≥ One of the primary goals of the project was to utilize containerization with Docker to facilitate environment management and ensure consistency between developer and production environments. However, during the configuration and execution of Docker containers, I encountered several issues related to environment setup and dependency management. The main causes of these problems were the lack of experience working with Docker and the need to tailor the configuration to the project's specifics.

### Integration Tests

üß™ Implementing integration tests was another challenge during the project. While these tests are a crucial element in ensuring code quality and application functionality, creating them required a significant amount of effort. I faced difficulties, especially in configuring tests, creating realistic test scenarios, and ensuring proper isolation of tests from the production environment.
